# BTC_Ticker_Arduino
A code for bitcoin ticker

This is my studying project for integrating Arduino(C++) device and a website (Pyton flask/django) into 1 complex project.

The final Idea:

Bitcoin ticker receives data from Binance stream and displays live on a 126x160 TFT screeen via WiFi.
User can control and set parameters via settings on a Website in personal account.
